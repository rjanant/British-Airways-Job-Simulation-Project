# British-Airways-Job-Simulation-Project


Task 1:
Background information - 
British Airways (BA) is the flag carrier airline of the United Kingdom (UK). Every day, thousands of BA flights arrive to and depart from the UK, carrying customers across the world. Whether it’s for holidays, work or any other reason, the end-to-end process of scheduling, planning, boarding, fuelling, transporting, landing, and continuously running flights on time, efficiently and with top-class customer service is a huge task with many highly important responsibilities.

As a data scientist at BA, it will be your job to apply your analytical skills to influence real life multi-million-pound decisions from day one, making a tangible impact on the business as your recommendations, tools and models drive key business decisions, reduce costs and increase revenue.

Customers who book a flight with BA will experience many interaction points with the BA brand. Understanding a customer's feelings, needs, and feedback is crucial for any business, including BA.

This first task is focused on scraping and collecting customer feedback and reviewing data from a third-party source and analysing this data to present any insights you may uncover.

1. Scrape data from the webite called Skytrax
2. Analyse data
3. Present insights

Objective: Understanding customer reviews and identifying key themes and sentiments.
Methodology: Scrape data from Skytrax, preprocess it and use LDA for topic modeling and Vader for sentiment analysis.
Key Findings: 
• Overall Positive Experience: 54.9% positive reviews vs 30.9% negative
• Strong positive sentiment clustering (0.75-1.0 range)
• High focus on core service elements: seating, timing, and crew
